# (Solution is given in Python 2)

#### In the given problem , we are supposed to find minimum number of coins to get the sum equal to the amount given

#### For given example
# - Input :

# 1. coins = [7 , 5 , 1]
# 2. amount = 18

# - O/p :
#     4

# We can achieve 18 by 
# - 2 Coins of 5
# - 1 coin of 7
# - 1 coin of 1
# - Sum = 4

# 18 can be achieved by various combinations of 7 , 5 , 1

# Refer the image above

# Lets call 11 , 13 , 17 , 6 , 12 , 10 ... as subSums

# As shown in the image above , 6 has been calculated previously and later on 6 is required in latter part .
# Instead of computing it again , we can store the value for 6 i.e 2 (1 coin of 5 and 1 coin of 1)

# As we need to store the value of recursion ie. Subsums in a memory , hence we choose DP here

# Consider a list op = [] with size equal to the amount

# op[] stores the number of coins required for each number from  1, 2 ,...amount 
# We are supposed to return op[amount] 

# In this case op[18] returns the minimum coins required to produce the sum 18
